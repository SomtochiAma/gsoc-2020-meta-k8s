# GSOC '20 - Cluster Addons: Package All Things!
Project tracker for my GSoC project - Cluster Addons: package all things!- for the Kubernetes organization (CNCF).

Progress tracker for my GSoC project for CNCF & Kubernetes - Cluster Addons: Package All Things!

To easier track the progress, I've created a [public trello board](https://trello.com/b/6kuguhLw/gsoc-2020-tracker-cluster-addons) where I'll be providing regular progress updates.

# Project Abstract

> Cluster Addons are resources that are considered inherently part of the Kubernetes
> cluster as they help extend the functionality of the cluster. Over time different
> addons have surfaced with increasing complexity while the tools for managing these
> addons have not progressed as much.

> The aim of this proposal is to build and package operators for different popular
> addons that are easy to use and follow best practices in various clusters.
